- **Web3.js**: Facilitates interaction with the blockchain network.

### Backend / Blockchain

- **ThirdWeb SDK**: Simplifies interaction with blockchain assets.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language used to create secure blockchain transactions.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for secure and tamper-resistant data storage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation and Setup

To set up FundFusion locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saurabhmaurya45/FundFusion.git
    cd FundFusion
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed, then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

    Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file with the following information:

    ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_THIRDWEB_API_KEY=your_thirdweb_api_key
    REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
    REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=your_blockchain_network
    ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

5. **Compile and Deploy Contracts**:

    Use Hardhat to compile and deploy Solidity contracts:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network your_network
    ```

6. **IPFS Integration**:

    Use IPFS for decentralized storage of project files. Configure IPFS and add files as needed.

## üí° Key Concepts

- **Blockchain Security**: Transactions and data are secured through blockchain, providing transparency and immutability.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Solidity contracts to manage transactions and enforce terms between companies and funders.
